Choosing & Scaling a Search

Good Practices
==============

Good practices are here to help you have the best outcome while using DeepHyper. Indeed, by using this software it is easy to consume a lot of computational ressources without having the expected outcomes. To help you do that we give you a list of things to follow each time you do an experiment:

* Always have a baseline model before starting using DeepHyper (see `deephyper.baseline`)
* Always try it on your local machine before running experiments at scale
* Always try it in debug queue before running experiments at scale: `debug-cache-quad` or `debug-flat-quad`
* Always take the time to analyze and understand the results of each experiment before submitting many
